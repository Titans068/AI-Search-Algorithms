# Some Search Techniques in Artificial Intelligence

This repository is a part of the Lab assignments of the course **CSE 714** (Artifical Intelligence Lab).

Here, I tried to implement some Search Algorithms (in Python 3.7.3) including:

- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Uniform Cost Search
- Depth Limited Search
- Iterative Deepening Search
- Bi-Directional Search
- Best First Search
- Greedy Search
- A* Search
- Iterative Deepening A*
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing
- Genetic Algorithm
